# proben1
Train neural network to solve Proben1 dataset problems

Proben1 is a dataset used fot neural network training.

With modern neural network training approach we can beat [results of 2003 year](http://fann.sourceforge.net/report/node8.html) results
* mean error train/test: 0.02341, 0.11555

[proben_test.py](/proben_test_py) - open source NN results:
* mean error train/test: 0.02009, 0.02898

Loss L2 was used for result measure
